## Playbook Execution Trace
| Step ID | Instruction | Status | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `step_1` | Identify 1. datetime, 2. Email address of sender/receiver, 3 IP address of sender/receiver and 4. subject of email. | **MET** | Identified phishing elements in alert doc: Incident INC-6142 details are as follows: The classification alert type is Multiple DNS Response on  |
| `step_2` | Does phishing attempt contain a URL or attachment? | **MET** | Identified phishing elements in alert doc: Incident INC-6142 details are as follows: The classification alert type is Multiple DNS Response on  |
| `step_3` | Was any malicious process spawned on the victim's machine? | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_4` | Analyze the process tree for signs of malicious activity, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_5` | Based on the analysis, determine if further investigation is necessary and the containment steps | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |

## Actions Taken
