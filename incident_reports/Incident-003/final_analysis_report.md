# INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: INC-6133 (Incident-003)

**Final Severity:** High
*Programmatic baseline triage for standalone alert.*

**Confidence Level:** High
*Heuristic lookup with no temporal correlation window overlaps.*

## Investigative Workflow
- Initial triage
- Indicator search
- Playbook heuristic validation

## Technical Chronology Summary
1. Multiple authentication attempts were initiated from source IP 5.1.57.22 targeting the user account 'sally' on bnpparibasgroup.com. 2. The login attempts resulted in failures, indicating a brute-force attack. 3. The suspicious authentication traffic was detected and flagged at the perimeter firewall.

## Playbook Execution Trace
| Step ID | Instruction | Status | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `step_1` | Identify 1. datetime, 2. Email address of sender/receiver, 3 IP address of sender/receiver and 4. subject of email. | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_2` | Does phishing attempt contain a URL or attachment? | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_3` | Was any malicious process spawned on the victim's machine? | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_4` | Analyze the process tree for signs of malicious activity, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_5` | Based on the analysis, determine if further investigation is necessary and the containment steps | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |

## Recommended Containment Actions
- Block all traffic from the external attacker IP 5.1.57.22 at the perimeter firewall immediately.
- Reset the password for user account 'sally' and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Review login logs to ensure no attempts from 5.1.57.22 succeeded.
