**Final Severity:** High
*Programmatic baseline triage for standalone alert.*

**Confidence Level:** High
*Heuristic lookup with no temporal correlation window overlaps.*

## Business Impact Assessment (Appendix C)
- **Critical System**: no
- **Essential Service**: no
- **Data Sensitivity**: no
- **Operational Impact**: no

## Technical Chronology Summary
1. An unauthorized attempt was made to escalate privileges on host 'RP-SOC/PHILLYVDI' (10.100.30.37) by user 'philly'. 2. The user account requested administrative privilege 'SeSecurityPrivilege'. 3. The privilege escalation requests failed and were flagged by local security auditing.

## Playbook Execution Trace
| Step ID | Instruction | Status | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `step_1` | Identify 1. username 2. IP address 3. Login Details 4. Computer name 5. Operating System | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_2` | Was it horizontal or vertical | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_3` | Was any malicious process spawned on the victim's machine? | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |
| `step_4` | Analyze the process tree for signs of malicious activity, such as privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration. | **MET** | Identified privilege escalation signs: Incident INC-6131 details are as follows: The classification alert type is Multiple Failed Privilege |
| `step_5` | Based on the analysis, determine if further investigation is necessary and the containment steps | **NOT_MET** | Timeline lacks necessary data to satisfy step. |

## Actions Taken
- Initial triage
- Indicator search
- Playbook heuristic validation

## Recommended Containment Actions
- Temporarily disable the user account 'philly' to prevent further unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
- Isolate the affected machine RP-SOC/PHILLYVDI at IP 10.100.30.37 (disable its network interface or block traffic at the switch) until the host is verified clean.
- Review security event logs on RP-SOC/PHILLYVDI to trace the origin of the 'SeSecurityPrivilege' requests.
