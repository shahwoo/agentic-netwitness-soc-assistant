# 🛡️ Agentic Threat Hunting & Autonomous Investigation Assistant  
### Integrated with RSA NetWitness SIEM

---

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered Security Operations Centre (SOC) assistant that automates alert triage, investigation, and incident reporting.

The system integrates with NetWitness SIEM and simulates real-world SOC workflows through multiple AI agents that replicate Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 analysts.

It is designed to handle high-volume security alerts and transform them into structured, actionable intelligence.

---

## 🎯 System Objectives
The system is designed to:

- Fetch alerts from NetWitness via REST APIs  
- Perform automated investigation pivots  
- Enrich alerts using multiple threat intelligence sources  
- Correlate logs and indicators across datasets  
- Compute dynamic risk scores  
- Execute playbook-driven analysis  
- Generate analyst-ready incident reports  
- Recommend response and remediation actions  

---

## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular, agent-driven architecture:

```
NetWitness SIEM → FastAPI Backend → AI Agents → Data Layer → Dashboard
```

### 🔍 Internal Data Flow

1. **Alert Ingestion**
   - Alerts are retrieved from NetWitness via REST APIs  
   - Raw logs are normalised into structured JSON format  

2. **Pre-processing Layer**
   - Key fields extracted (IP, domain, hash, user activity)  
   - Data cleaned and standardised for downstream processing  

3. **Agent Pipeline Execution**
   - Data passed sequentially through:
     - Triage Agent → Investigation Agent → Response Agent  

4. **Data Storage**
   - Structured results stored in PostgreSQL  
   - Contextual embeddings stored in ChromaDB  

5. **Output Layer**
   - Results displayed in dashboard  
   - Reports generated for analysts

## 🔴 Agentic SOC Workflow

### 🧩 Agent Design Concept
Each agent operates as:
- A reasoning unit (LLM)
- A tool user (API calls, database queries)
- A playbook executor (structured workflow)

---

### 1. Triage Agent (Tier 1)

**Input:**
- Raw alert from NetWitness  

**Process:**
- Extract indicators (IP, URL, hash)  
- Query threat intelligence APIs  
- Validate whether alert is a false positive  

**Output:**
- Enriched alert  
- Initial severity classification  

---

### 2. Investigation Agent (Tier 2)

**Input:**
- Enriched alert  

**Process:**
- Perform correlation:
  - Cross-log correlation  
  - Indicator relationship mapping  
- Query historical data from database  
- Retrieve similar past incidents from ChromaDB (RAG)  
- Map findings to:
  - Cyber Kill Chain stages  
  - MITRE ATT&CK techniques  

**Output:**
- Investigation findings  
- Attack pattern identification  

---

### 3. Response Agent (Tier 3)

**Input:**
- Investigation results  

**Process:**
- Compute risk score  
- Evaluate impact and likelihood  
- Apply predefined playbooks  

**Output:**
- Final incident report  
- Recommended actions (containment, eradication, recovery)

## 🌐 Threat Intelligence Integration

Integrated APIs:

- VirusTotal  
- AbuseIPDB  
- AlienVault OTX  
- GreyNoise  
- URLhaus  

### 🔍 Enrichment Process
For each indicator:
1. Query multiple APIs  
2. Aggregate responses  
3. Assign confidence score  
4. Store enrichment results  

---

## 📊 Risk Scoring Model

### 🧮 Risk Calculation Logic

Risk Score is derived from:

```
Risk = (Severity Weight × Indicator Score) 
     + (Correlation Weight × Event Frequency)
     + (Attack Stage Weight × Kill Chain Progression)
```

### Factors Explained:

- **Indicator Score**  
  Based on reputation from threat intelligence  

- **Event Frequency**  
  Number of related logs/events  

- **Kill Chain Stage**
  Later stages = higher risk  

---

### Output:
- Severity: Low / Medium / High  
- Confidence Score  
- Recommended Actions  

---

## 📄 Automated Reporting

Each report includes:

- Executive summary  
- Detailed investigation steps  
- Timeline of attack  
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Risk analysis  
- Recommended response actions
